# Back to Basics
This repository is to refine my skills by re-learning the basics I've forgotten or never knew, and building a sturdy foundation I can use to improve my future work.

# Getting Started
Open **cssFundamentals.html** in a browser. There's nothing special right now.

# Roadmap

Currently I'm working on:
* CSS4
* HTML5

Future improvements:
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Angular
* Bootstrap
* Java 8/9
* Implementing database connections
* Integrating with AWS
* Improving architecture
* Writing tests/TDD
* Spring MVC
* Hibernate
* Maven

# Project Structure
The project is very basic right now with all code existing under the 'src' folder. Only an html file exists right now.

## Tests
There currently are no tests.
